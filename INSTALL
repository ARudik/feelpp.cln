Installation:
=============

As with any autoconfiguring GNU software, installation is as easy as this:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ make install

You need GNU make. On HP-UX, you also need GNU sed.

Known to work with:
  - Linux/x86, gcc-2.95.x, gcc-3.[0-4]
  - Linux/x86_64, gcc-3.[3-4]
  - Linux/ia64, gcc-2.96, gcc-3.[2-3]
  - Linux/arm, gcc-2.95.3, gcc-3.[0-3]
  - Linux/mips, gcc-3.3
  - Linux/sparc, gcc-2.95.3, gcc-3.[1-3]
  - Linux/alpha, gcc-2.95.x, gcc-3.[0-3]
  - Linux/powerpc, gcc-2.95.x, gcc-3.[0-3]
  - Solaris 2.4 (sparc), gcc-2.95, gcc-3.[1-3]
  - OSF/1 V4.0 (alpha), gcc-2.95, gcc-3.1
  - Irix 6.5, gcc-2.95.x, gcc-3.0
  - BeOS, gcc-2.95.x

The "make" step takes about 30 minutes, on a P-III / 1 GHz / 512 MB.

If you use g++ gcc-2.95.x or gcc-3.x, I recommend adding "-fno-exceptions" 
to the CXXFLAGS. This will likely generate better code.

If you use g++ from gcc-3.0.4 or older on Sparc, add either "-O", "-O1" or
"-O2 -fno-schedule-insns" to the CXXFLAGS. With full "-O2", g++ miscompiles
the division routines. If you use g++ older than 2.95.3 on Sparc you should
also specify --disable-shared because of bad code produced in the shared
library. Also, do not use gcc-3.0 on Sparc for compiling CLN, it won't work
at all.

If you use g++ on OSF/1 or Tru64 using gcc-2.95.x, you should specify
--disable-shared because of linker problems with duplicate symbols in shared
libraries.  If you use g++ from gcc-3.0.n with n larger than 1, you should
not add -fno-exceptions to the CXXFLAGS, since that will generate wrong code
(gcc-3.1 is okay again, as is gcc-3.0).

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the documentation,
in the doc/ directory.
