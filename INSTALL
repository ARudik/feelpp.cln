Installation:
=============

As with any autoconfiguring GNU software, installation is as easy as this:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ make install

You need GNU make. On HP-UX, you also need GNU sed.

Known to work with:
  - Linux/x86, gcc-2.7.0, gcc-2.7.2, gcc-2.8.0, egcs-1.1, gcc-2.95
  - Solaris 2.4 (sparc), gcc-2.7.0, gcc-2.7.2, egcs-1.1, gcc-2.95
  - OSF/1 V4.0 (alpha), egcs-1.1, gcc-2.95
  - Irix 5.3, CC 4

The "make" step takes about 4 hours, on a 486 DX / 33 MHz / 8 MB.

On Linux, g++ needs 15 MB to compile the tests. So better have
17 MB swap space and 1 MB room in $TMPDIR.

If you use gcc and g++ version 2.7.x, don't add -O2 to the CXXFLAGS, because
"g++ -O" generates better code for libcln.a than "g++ -O2".

If you use g++ version 2.8.x or egcs-2.91.x (a.k.a. egcs-1.1) or gcc-2.95.x,
I recommend adding "-fno-exceptions" to the CXXFLAGS. This will likely
generate better code.

If you use g++ version egcs-2.91.x (egcs-1.1) or gcc-2.95.x on Sparc, add
either "-O", "-O1" or "-O2 -fno-schedule-insns" to the CXXFLAGS. With full 
"-O2", g++ miscompiles the division routines. Also, if you have g++ version
egcs-1.1.1 or older on Sparc, you must specify --disable-shared because g++
would miscompile parts of the library.

On MIPS (SGI Irix 6), pass option "--without-gmp" to configure. gmp does
not work when compiled in "n32" binary format on Irix.

More detailed installation instructions can be found in the documentation,
in the doc/ directory.
